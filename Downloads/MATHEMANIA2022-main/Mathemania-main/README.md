## Contribution Guide
Before making any contributions, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/acicts/BITS21/issues) section and describe the issue or the bug you found clearly with images. When describing your issue, please use the given appropriate template and nothing else.

### How to contribute

 1. As the first step, you need to fork the BITS21 repository to your own GitHub profile.

2. To run the website on your local machine, you need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) as a dependency.

3. You have to clone your forked repository to your local computer. For that, you have to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Use the below command to clone the repository to your computer using the below command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/BITS21.git
```

4. Then navigate to root folder of the project and run the below command.

```bash
npm install
```
	
This will install all the dependencies you need to run the app in the developer mode.

5. Then to run the app, use command below

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a live server on the url [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
	
6. Then you can do changes to the codebase on your local machine. If you are doing some changes to the code, just change the parts that you have to change and donâ€™t touch any other files.

7. After you finish doing your changes, commit them and push them to your repository. If you don't know how to do that, you can read [this article](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/).

8. Then you can make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/acicts/BITS21/pulls) to the `main` branch of the origin repository. When you are making the pull request follow the PR template exactly.
